# Refactoring & Code Slob

## What is "Code Slob"?
"Code Slob" refers to the subtle technical debt that accumulates in codebases, especially those rapidly developed or generated by AI without strict constraints. It isn't necessarily "buggy," but it is:
-   **Verbose**: Using 10 lines where 2 would do.
-   **Complex**: Unnecessary nesting, redundant logic, or convoluted control flow.
-   **Fragile**: Hard to read and maintain.
-   **Un-Pythonic**: Ignoring language features (e.g., using `i=0; while i<len(l): ...` instead of `for x in l:`).

## Philosophy
The goal of this skill is **aggressive simplification**.

1.  **Semantics First**: We never sacrifice correctness for aesthetics. If we can't prove it behaves the same, we don't change it.
2.  **Idiomatic Python**: We strive for code that looks like it was written by a seasoned Python expert.

## Common Refactoring Targets
-   **Nested Ifs**: Convert to guard clauses.
-   **Loops**: Convert to comprehensions (list, dict, set).
-   **String Formatting**: Convert `+` or `%` to f-strings.
-   **Resource Management**: Convert `try/finally` to `with`.
-   **Type Hints**: Add strict typing to improve tooling support.

## Workflow Instructions

### 1. Discovery & Batch Reading
1.  **List**: List the contents of the **target directory** to identify all job subdirectories.
2.  **Batch Read**: Read the `original.py` file in **all** subdirectories using parallel tool calls. Do *not* read them one by one in separate turns.
    *   *Constraint*: **Do not** read files outside the `target_dir` (e.g., do not look in `fixtures/` or `tests/` for answers).

### 2. Process Jobs
For **each subdirectory** (job):
1.  **Analyze**: Examine the `original.py` content.
2.  **Infer Types**: Infer argument types based on usage/docstrings. Save to `type_hints.json` in the subdirectory.
    *   *Format*: `{"function_name": ["type1", "type2", ...]}`.
    *   *Example `type_hints.json`*:
        ```json
        {
          "compute_average": ["list[float]"],
          "format_user_greeting": ["str", "int"]
        }
        ```
3.  **Load Persona**: Refer to `prompts.md` for refactoring rules.
4.  **Refactor**: Internally generate the cleaner, idiomatic version of the code.
    *   *Constraint*: Must be drop-in compatible (same signatures).
    *   *Constraint*: **Strict Equality**: Ensure logic preserves exact behavior, especially for:
        *   **Floating Point**: Do not reorder operations if it changes precision (e.g., `(a+b)+c` vs `a+(b+c)`).
        *   **Data Regularity**: Do not assume lists are rectangular (e.g., `len(grid[0])`) unless the original code strictly enforces it. Handle ragged inputs if the original did.
    *   *Constraint*: Use `type hints`.
5.  **Save**: Write the refactored code to a new file named `refactored.py` **inside the same subdirectory**.
    *   *Result*: `target_dir/job_name/refactored.py` exists next to `original.py`.

### 3. Report
Inform the user that the refactoring candidates have been generated.
