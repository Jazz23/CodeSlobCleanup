MCP/Skills/Coding Agents
Visualization
name: visualization
Objective: One issue with coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, gemini-cli, and possible others) is not being able to visualize results/work-in-progress. Create a read-only website that monitors code agent progress/status.
There should be a “simple” setup/consistent across the different coding agents (maybe hooks in claude code, Events in codex, ??? in gemini-cli…) that populates/tracks the same status which can be visualized (local run webbrowser that exposes a common API?) It may be nice to allow remote servers so that status can be shared/checked on the phone when on the move.
