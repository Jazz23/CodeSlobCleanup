RISC-V Assembly to C++ Translation Agent
name: asm2cpp
Objective: Create an agent that translates RISC-V assembly code into modern C++17 code using LLMs.
Starting from tools like Codex-Decompiler, develop an agent that uses fine-tuned LLMs to convert RISC-V assembly into C++17. Generate a comprehensive dataset of assembly-to-C++ examples, possibly using tools like Ghidra or RetDec. Employ fuzzing or equivalence checking with tools like Alive2 to ensure functional equivalence.
