Pyrope tree-sitter Formatting
name: prpfmt
Objective: Create a Pyrope formatting tool that traverses the tree-sitter grammar and produces standardized formatted Pyrope. Requirements include support for format on/off directives in comments and vertical alignment (similar to clang-format). Check tree-sitter-pyrope/prpfmt.c as not working code but possible starting point.
